TOWNSSURVEY_POLY.shp - contains shapefile for map of Massachusetts towns. This file is what the R code reads, so it should be in the working directory you set in the R code.

Maps.R - contains code that produces a map of Massachusetts towns, with each district shaded a different color. Outputs map as a PDF file (we can change to JPG or some other format later if needed). Need to copy in list of towns in each district from Jupyter notebook/Python.

EfficiencyGap.ipynb - Efficiency Gap LP model.

PartisanBias.ipynb - Partisan Bias LP model.
