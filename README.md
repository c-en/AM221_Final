TOWNSSURVEY_POLY.(various extensions) - contain shapefile for map of Massachusetts towns. These files are what the R code reads, so they should be in the working directory you set in the R code.

Maps.R - contains code that produces a map of Massachusetts towns, with each district shaded a different color. Outputs map as a PDF file (we can change to JPG or some other format later if needed). Need to copy in list of towns in each district from Jupyter notebook/Python.

EfficiencyGap.ipynb - Efficiency Gap LP model.
